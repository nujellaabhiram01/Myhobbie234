        <p>I am Abhiram a Whitehat Jr coder who has created several applications in 2020 an year that we can never forget.
        
         I like to play cricket as it is my hobby and I also like to code and study.
         The cricket player I like is Rohit Sharma,he plays fantasticly and is a very good player.I like especially his sixes,WOW!They are so high that it is very tough for a fielder to catch the ball.He is also a very good captain for leading his team in the IPL(Indian Premier League)Cricket leaugue that is MI(Mumbai Indians)team.I like him a lot and in cricket he is my motivation.
